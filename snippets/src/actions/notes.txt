'actions' folder is created because we can't create 'server actions' inside client side component or CSR.
To use server actions inside client side component, we will create all the server-actions here in this folder called actions

We will create server actions and then export it. Later inside CSR component will we import these server-actions. In this way,
we don't have to worry about creating server action inside client side component.
